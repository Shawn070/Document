# 1. Intruduction：
Good afternoon,my dear professors:  
　I'm glad to be here for the interview.First of all,I'd like to introduce myself.My name is TANG YU XIAO.I am 23 years old.My hometown is Dujiangyan,a beautiful city in Sichuan province.Because of Li Bing and his son's contribution of irrigation system，Dujiangyan not only enjoys beautiful scenery，but also has profound history.  
　Second,I will introduce my major in the university.My major is Measuring and Control Technology and Instrumentation in Hefei University of Technology and I will finish it in July this year.The major involves so many aspects，such as light，machinery,electronic circuit and computer.I specialize in electonic circruit and computer so that every time our teachers lead us to make some Course Designs about them, I always finish them soon and well.  
　Well, in my spare time, I like to flash new roms into my android phone.Every time when my android phone bootloads successfully,I get really excited which just like my c program runs successfully on the hardware after debugging it in thousands of times.So I learned some knowledge about Embedded Systems, Linux and GitHub which is a open source code web and I learned a lot from it.I also like to learn some Photoshop skills and Computer repair skills  to enrich myself which really helped me a lot during my college period.  
　OK,that's all.Thank you for your attention.

#### 2. The reason for taking part in the national post-graduate entrance examination / postgraduate qualification exam：
　In my university, I usually hear about our professors talking about professional researches and I have been deeply impressed by the academic atmosphere.I think postgraduate study provides people with enough room to get further enrichment.I think this is my first reason.  
　The second one is I am long for doing some research in  this university throughout my life.It's my pleasure to be with my favorite scientific research for my lifetime. And I think this is the most important factor in my decision.  
　Thirdly, I think further study is still urgent for me to realize my value.Life is precious,it is necessary for us to seize any opportunity for self-development,especially during our competitive period in our life.

### 3. plan in the postgraduate time
　Well, I think I am a tough person.In my undergraduate time,when we do some experiments, I always want to make them perfect.So I usually do some researches on the internet before the experiments that save me a lot of time and make me more efficient. So I really want to get far more study on my professions,if possible, I will go on with my study for Doctorate degree.

### 4. family
　There are four members in my family. My grandmother, my parents and me.My home is located at a little town in Dujiangyan. My grandma is a farmer ,my father works in a automobile assembly plant and my mother does some business at our town.In my university  class, most of my classmates choose southeast university and my undergraduate university, but I choose Chongqing University because it closes to my home, just like the Master said, "While his parents are alive, the son may not go abroad to a distance." And this is one of my important reasons to choose Chongqing University. During preparing for coming here, my family's love and support have always been my power. So I hope I will be able to repay them in the future.

### 5. hometown
　Dujiangyan is my hometown that is a county-level city under the jurisdiction of Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province. Dujiangyan is famous with the irrigation system that was originally constructed as a water conservation and flood control project. The system's infrastructure is located on the Min River, which is the longest tributary of the Yangtze, in Sichuan. Dujiangyan is famous for still providing neighboring major city Chengdu with water even though it was built around 250 BC.

### 6. university
　Hefei University of Technology is a major and key university, with particular strength in Engineering and Management Science. It is built in 1945 and is located in Hefei, the capital of the Anhui Province. It has been listed in Project 211 and Project 985 Innovation Platform.My university have three Campuses, one for teachers, one for freshman and sophomore, the last one for the junior, senior and postgraduates. Athough my university is not big enough, it has a good learning atmosphere. I really like our library where all people concentrate on their studies quietly. In a word, I really cherish the the of the time in my university.  
　Thank you!

#### Accuracy and Precision:

Accuracy refers to the closeness of a measured value to a standard or known value. For example, if in lab you obtain a weight measurement of 3.2 kg for a given substance, but the actual or known weight is 10 kg, then your measurement is not accurate. In this case, your measurement is not close to the known value.  

Precision refers to the closeness of two or more measurements to each other. Using the example above, if you weigh a given substance five times, and get 3.2 kg each time, then your measurement is very precise. Precision is independent of accuracy. You can be very precise but inaccurate, as described above. You can also be accurate but imprecise.  

For example, if on average, your measurements for a given substance are close to the known value, but the measurements are far from each other, then you have accuracy without precision.  

A good analogy for understanding accuracy and precision is to imagine a basketball player shooting baskets. If the player shoots with accuracy, his aim will always take the ball close to or into the basket. If the player shoots with precision, his aim will always take the ball to the same location which may or may not be close to the basket. A good player will be both accurate and precise by shooting the ball the same way each time and each time making it in the basket.
